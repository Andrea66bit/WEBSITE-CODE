üéß JVYSTVR BO≈Ω√ç Music App & Website ‚Äì Overview
JVYSTVR BO≈Ω√ç Music is a music streaming platform designed to let users discover, play, and manage music in a beautifully styled yellow-themed interface. It offers user authentication (login/register), a customizable library, trending music, and playlists.

üîë Core Features
1. User Authentication
Register Page: Allows new users to sign up using email and password.

Login Page: Securely verifies registered users before giving access to the music platform.

Social Login Options (Simulated): Users can choose to "sign in" via Google or Facebook.

Authentication data is stored in localStorage (for demo/testing purposes).

2. Music Homepage (index.html)
After logging in, users are redirected to the main page which includes:

Sidebar Navigation: Links to library, playlists, trending, etc.

Library Section: A collection of user-selected or recently played music.

Trending Section: Shows popular or trending tracks.

Playlist Section: Custom or curated playlists.

Yellow-Themed UI: Distinct branding with a stylish and cheerful color palette.
